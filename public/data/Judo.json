The development path in Judo can be divided into different levels:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Beginner Level:</strong> At this stage, individuals start learning the basic techniques and principles of Judo. They focus on developing fundamental skills such as falling safely (ukemi), basic throws (nage-waza), and ground techniques (ne-waza).</li>\n  \n  <li><strong>Intermediate Level:</strong> Once the beginner level is mastered, practitioners move on to the intermediate level. Here, they deepen their understanding of Judo techniques and begin to explore more advanced throws, combinations, and transitions. They also learn various gripping strategies and defensive techniques.</li>\n  \n  <li><strong>Advanced Level:</strong> At the advanced level, practitioners refine their techniques and focus on developing speed, power, and precision. They learn advanced throws, counters, and submissions. They also study the principles of body movement, leverage, and timing to gain a competitive edge.</li>\n  \n  <li><strong>Competitive Level:</strong> For those interested in competitive Judo, this level involves participating in tournaments and matches. Competitors learn specific strategies, tactics, and competition rules. They work on improving their physical conditioning, mental focus, and overall performance to succeed in competitive settings.</li>\n  \n  <li><strong>Instructor Level:</strong> Some Judo practitioners aspire to become instructors or coaches. At this level, individuals undergo specialized training to become certified instructors. They learn teaching methodologies, pedagogy, and how to effectively communicate and demonstrate techniques to students.</li>\n  \n  <li><strong>Master Level:</strong> The highest level in Judo is the mastery level. It represents a lifelong commitment to the art and continuous self-improvement. Masters have extensive knowledge, experience, and expertise in Judo. They may hold high-ranking black belts and are often recognized for their contributions to the development and promotion of Judo.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For more detailed information about the development path in Judo, you can visit the official website of the International Judo Federation (IJF) at <a href=\"https://www.ijf.org/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ijf.org/</a>.</p>"
