They are just starting to learn the basics of riding a bike, such as balancing, pedaling, and steering. Beginners may start by riding on flat, paved surfaces and gradually build up their confidence and skills.</p>\n\n  <li><strong>Level 2: Intermediate</strong></li>\n  <p>Once individuals have mastered the basics, they can progress to the intermediate level. At this stage, cyclists can comfortably ride on various terrains, including roads, bike paths, and light trails. They may start exploring longer distances and increasing their endurance. Intermediate cyclists may also begin to learn basic bike maintenance and repair skills.</p>\n\n  <li><strong>Level 3: Advanced</strong></li>\n  <p>Advanced cyclists have honed their skills and are capable of tackling more challenging routes and terrains. They have developed a good level of fitness and endurance, allowing them to participate in longer rides and potentially even races. Advanced cyclists may also start focusing on specific disciplines within cycling, such as road cycling, mountain biking, or track cycling.</p>\n\n  <li><strong>Level 4: Expert</strong></li>\n  <p>At the expert level, cyclists have reached the pinnacle of their abilities. They have extensive experience and knowledge in their chosen discipline and may have achieved notable accomplishments in competitions or events. Expert cyclists often have a deep understanding of training techniques, bike mechanics, and advanced riding skills.</p>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It's important to note that the development path in cycling is not linear, and individuals may progress at different rates. It's also crucial to prioritize safety and gradually increase the difficulty of rides to avoid injuries. As cyclists progress through the levels, they can continue to challenge themselves, set new goals, and explore different aspects of the cycling world.</p>"
