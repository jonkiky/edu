Participants need to visualize the target and understand the spatial relationship between themselves, the bow, and the target.</li>\n  <li><strong>Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence:</strong> 5/5 - This is crucial in archery.

Understanding one's own strengths and weaknesses, and being able to control emotions and focus, are key.</li>\n  <li><strong>Naturalist Intelligence:</strong> 3/5 - Being in tune with the natural environment, such as understanding wind direction and speed, can enhance performance in outdoor archery.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Overall Rating: 29/40</p>\n\n<p>Reasons: Archery is a sport that requires a mix of different intelligences.
