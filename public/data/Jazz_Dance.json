These dances incorporated elements of rhythm, improvisation, and syncopation.</p>\n  \n  <li><strong>Level 2: The Jazz Age</strong></li>\n  <p>In the 1920s, jazz music gained popularity, and with it, jazz dance began to emerge as a distinct style. Dancers like Josephine Baker and the Nicholas Brothers showcased their unique moves and brought jazz dance into the mainstream.</p>\n  \n  <li><strong>Level 3: The Golden Era</strong></li>\n  <p>In the 1940s and 1950s, jazz dance reached its golden era. Influenced by tap dance and ballet, jazz dance incorporated more technical elements, such as leaps, turns, and isolations. Legendary choreographers like Jack Cole and Bob Fosse revolutionized the style with their innovative choreography.</p>\n  \n  <li><strong>Level 4: Fusion and Modernization</strong></li>\n  <p>In the 1960s and 1970s, jazz dance started to fuse with other dance styles, such as contemporary, hip-hop, and funk. This fusion led to the development of new and diverse jazz dance techniques and movements.</p>\n  \n  <li><strong>Level 5: Contemporary Jazz</strong></li>\n  <p>In recent years, jazz dance has continued to evolve and adapt to contemporary trends.
