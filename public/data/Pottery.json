It involves the creation of objects, typically vessels, from clay that are then fired at high temperatures to harden them. The development path of pottery can be divided into several levels:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Level 1: Handbuilding Techniques</strong></li>\n  <p>At the beginner level, individuals learn handbuilding techniques. This involves shaping clay by hand using various methods such as pinch pots, coiling, and slab construction. These techniques allow for the creation of basic forms like bowls, cups, and plates.</p>\n\n  <li><strong>Level 2: Wheel Throwing</strong></li>\n  <p>Once individuals have mastered handbuilding techniques, they can progress to wheel throwing. This involves using a pottery wheel to shape the clay into symmetrical forms such as bowls, vases, and mugs. Wheel throwing requires practice and skill to center the clay and create consistent shapes.</p>\n\n  <li><strong>Level 3: Surface Decoration</strong></li>\n  <p>After gaining proficiency in shaping clay, individuals can focus on surface decoration. This includes techniques like carving, stamping, and painting to add texture, patterns, and designs to the pottery. Surface decoration enhances the aesthetic appeal of the finished pieces.</p>\n\n  <li><strong>Level 4: Glazing and Firing</strong></li>\n  <p>Glazing is the process of applying a glass-like coating to pottery to give it a smooth, glossy finish and make it waterproof. Learning about different glazes and their application techniques is an important part of the pottery development path. Firing refers to the process of heating the pottery in a kiln to a specific temperature to harden the clay and fuse the glaze.</p>\n\n  <li><strong>Level 5: Advanced Techniques</strong></li>\n  <p>At the advanced level, potters can explore more complex techniques such as sculpting, mold-making, and alternative firing methods like raku or pit firing. These techniques allow for greater artistic expression and experimentation.</p>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Engaging in pottery can be a fulfilling and lifelong journey of learning and creativity. It offers individuals the opportunity to develop their skills and express their artistic vision through the creation of unique and functional ceramic objects.</p>"}, {"title": "Key Competitions", "system": "please use html <p>, <ul> tag to style your response. all the link should be open in a new tag using target _blank property", "desc": "List key competitions you may be interested in.", "query": "we are looking for the information related to the involve in an activity of Pottery, you need to provide at least 5 key competitions that are USA-based or international for juniors who like Pottery.
