Children interested in becoming professional sculptors should consider the following steps to help them on their journey:</p><ul>  <li><strong>Start with basics:</strong> Young kids can begin sculpting using easily moldable materials like clay, play dough, or plasticine. This allows them to get a feel for shaping and forming objects with their hands.</li>  <li><strong>Take art classes:</strong> Participate in art classes specifically focused on sculpture or general art to learn different techniques and materials. Classes offered by schools, local community centers, or art museums can be very beneficial.</li>  <li><strong>Practice regularly:</strong> Just like any other skill, sculpting requires a lot of practice. Encourage kids to create something new each day, no matter how small, to improve their skills and creativity.</li>  <li><strong>Study from the masters:</strong> Visit museums or galleries, either virtually or in person, to study the work of famous sculptors. </li>  <li><strong>Learn about materials:</strong> As kids grow older, they can experiment with a variety of materials such as wood, stone, metal, and more to understand their properties and how they can be used in sculpting.</li>  <li><strong>Attend workshops:</strong> Workshops can offer specialized training in different sculpting techniques and materials, for example, metalworking, woodworking, or stone carving.</li>  <li><strong>Focus on art in education:</strong> When choosing high school courses, or considering college, focus on art-related subjects. Consider a degree in Fine Arts with a focus on sculpture if pursuing higher education.</li>  <li><strong>Build a portfolio:</strong> Document every piece of sculpture created. Good quality photographs or digital representations of the work will become part of a portfolio, which is essential for admissions to art programs and eventually for professional opportunities.</li>  <li><strong>Enter competitions:</strong> Participating in art and sculpture competitions can not only improve skills but also provide a platform for exposure and constructive feedback.</li>  <li><strong>Network with other artists:</strong> Attending art events, joining clubs, or participating in online communities can be an effective way of making connections that can lead to opportunities and collaborations.</li>  <li><strong>Consider apprenticeships:</strong> Working under a professional sculptor as an apprentice can provide invaluable real-world experience and mentorship.</li>  <li><strong>Stay inspired and innovative:</strong> Keep exploring new ideas, and don't be afraid to push the boundaries of your art.
