	"development": "
	<div><p>When it comes to the development path in weightlifting, there are several levels that individuals can progress through. These levels are designed to help athletes improve their skills, strength, and technique over time. Here is a general overview of the development path in weightlifting:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Beginner Level:</strong> 
  <br/>At the beginner level, individuals are just starting their weightlifting journey. They may have little to no experience with weightlifting and are learning the basic movements and techniques. Beginners focus on building a foundation of strength and developing proper form and technique.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Intermediate Level:</strong> <br/>Once individuals have gained some experience and proficiency in the basic weightlifting movements, they can progress to the intermediate level. At this stage, athletes start to increase the intensity and volume of their training. They work on improving their strength, power, and technique through more advanced exercises and training methods.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Advanced Level:</strong> <br/>The advanced level is for athletes who have mastered the fundamental weightlifting movements and have a solid foundation of strength and technique. At this stage, athletes focus on fine-tuning their skills, increasing their strength and power, and preparing for competitive weightlifting. They may also start participating in local or regional weightlifting competitions.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Elite Level:</strong> <br/>The elite level is reserved for the top-tier weightlifters who have achieved exceptional strength, technique, and performance. These athletes compete at the national and international level, representing their countries in prestigious competitions such as the Olympics or World Championships. They undergo rigorous training programs, work with experienced coaches, and constantly strive to improve their performance.</li>

<p>It's important to note that the development path in weightlifting is not linear, and individuals progress at their own pace. Some athletes may move through the levels quickly, while others may take more time to reach higher levels of proficiency. Consistent training, proper technique, and dedication are key factors in progressing along the development path in weightlifting.</p></div>"
