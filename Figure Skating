Assessing Enjoyment and Talent in Figure Skating


Determining whether a child will enjoy and excel in figure skating involves observing several key indicators and fostering an environment where their potential can naturally emerge. Here's how parents and guardians can assess a child's inclination and aptitude for the sport:

Initial Reactions: Pay attention to the child's first reactions to ice skating. Are they excited and eager to return to the rink, or do they seem indifferent or reluctant?
