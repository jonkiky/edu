Nordic skiing involves using long, narrow skis and poles to propel oneself across flat or gently rolling terrain.</li>\n  \n  <li><strong>Alpine Skiing:</strong> Alpine skiing, also known as downhill skiing, gained popularity in the early 20th century. It involves skiing down slopes or mountains at higher speeds. Alpine skiing introduced the use of ski lifts and groomed slopes, making it more accessible to a wider audience. This form of skiing includes various disciplines such as slalom, giant slalom, super-G, and downhill.</li>\n  \n  <li><strong>Freestyle Skiing:</strong> Freestyle skiing emerged in the 1960s and gained recognition as an official Olympic sport in 1992. It combines elements of acrobatics, aerials, moguls, and ski ballet. Freestyle skiing allows for creative expression and includes tricks, jumps, and flips performed on specially designed terrain parks and halfpipes.</li>\n  \n  <li><strong>Backcountry Skiing:</strong> Backcountry skiing, also known as off-piste skiing, involves skiing in unmarked or unpatrolled areas outside of ski resorts. It offers the opportunity to explore untouched snow and remote mountainous regions. Backcountry skiing requires specialized equipment and knowledge of avalanche safety.</li>\n  \n  <li><strong>Telemark Skiing:</strong> Telemark skiing is a technique that combines elements of Nordic and Alpine skiing. It originated in Norway and involves a free-heel binding system, allowing the skier to perform lunging turns. Telemark skiing requires a specific type of ski and boot setup and is known for its graceful and fluid movements.</li>\n  \n  <li><strong>Adaptive Skiing:</strong> Adaptive skiing is a form of skiing designed for individuals with disabilities. It includes various adaptations and equipment modifications to accommodate different physical abilities.
